- Have python & django installed in the system.
- In root directory of backend project, open it in terminal, run the command 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
- Setup pgadmin with the database file shared in google drive.
- Open command prompt, and type 'ipconfig', and note down the ip address (It will be of format something like : 192.168.254.4)
- In root directory of backend project, open it in terminal, or vscode, or any code editor, and then in terminal, type in
'python manage.py runserver [IP ADDRESS THAT WAS NOTED]:8001
FOR EXAMPLE, if ip address is 192.168.254.2, then type 'python manage.py runserver 192.168.254.2:8001'
- Now the backend server will be running successfully on your system as localhost.


TO SETUP THE APP,

- Install and setup flutter and vscode - https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows/mobile?tab=download
- After succesfully setting up flutter, open frontend project folder, goto -> lib/apis/open apis.dart file, you will see something like this in that file:
class Apis{
  String anytime = "http://192.168.254.24:8001";
  String droid="http://192.168.254.24:8001";
}

Replace the ipaddress part with one that was noted while setting up backend project.

- Run command 'fluter build apk --release', in root directory of frontend project, once it succesfully completes, goto root directory -> build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/ you will find 'app-release.apk', save this apk file for installation on your mobile. Make sure backend server is running while testing mobile app.
